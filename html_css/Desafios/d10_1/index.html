            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>
            <p>
                You probably know that the Android operating system, maintained by Google, is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>
            <h2>The first version</h2>
            <p>
                The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named Dan Morrill. He says he opened Inkscape (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

            <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: it would be the Dandroids.</p>

            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>
            <p>
                The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.

            </picture>
            <p>
                Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with the person looking at it. Then came the Bugdroid, the new mascot of Android.

            <p>
                The main inspiration for the features of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the Google office and looked at the restrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

            <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version: 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>

                Unfortunately, Android Q did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.
